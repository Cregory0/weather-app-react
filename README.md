## General info

What developers portolfio wouldn’t be complete without a weather app?! I’ve built a few weather apps in the past with vanilla JavaScript but I wanted to build one using React.

## Getting started

```
npm start
```

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

```
npm run build
```

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Then the app is ready to be deployed!
